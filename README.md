## Description

Ever wanted a readily available site where you can update your teammates and have access to their information at all times? This application does just that! By answering just a couple questions, you will be able to input your team's information and have that info available.

## Table of Contents

## Installation

In order to install and use this application, you would need to run the following code:

```
npm i
```

This will install inquirer which will be the main method to ask you questions for the inputs. This will also install jest which you will need for the [Tests](#tests) section later on!

## Usage

Once all of the node packages are installed, you will be able to  run the application by utilizing the following code block.

```
node index
```

You will then be prompted with several questions. Once you have successfully answered all of the questions, an index.html file will be generated in your dist folder for you to view!
